# Welcome to my comp!

This repository holds all of the data and code files for my comp. As I write code, I will periodically push it to GitHub so that it is backed up in different versions (in case I mess it up and need to go back). I will be coding in R, so the data files are all `.csv` files and the code live in the `.r` file.

### Description of files
* This will go here
* I'm not doing this right now
* It's just to make the repository look organized in case anyone wants to look at it
* Not a priority for me sis
